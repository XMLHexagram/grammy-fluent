[Fluent][fluent-website] localization system integration
for [grammY][grammy-website] Telegram bot framework.


## Why Fluent?

I've studied several i18n standards and message formats and
have found that Fluent has all the required features and
at the same time provides a very user-friendly message format,
which is very important for non-dev people (i.e. translators).

It is also supported by **Mozilla Foundation**, a well-respected
leader in world of OpenSource and the Web standards.

### Message format example

Consider the following message format example and see for yourself:

```fluent
-brand-name = Super Project

welcome =
  Welcome, {$name}, to the {-brand-name}!
  Your balance is: {
    NUMBER($value, maximumFractionDigits: 2)
  }
  You have { NUMBER($applesCount) ->
    [0] no apples
    [one] {$applesCount} apple
    *[other] {$applesCount} apples
  }
```

### Fluent features

- Variable substitution (aka placeables),

- Built-in and custom formatters that could be applied
  to the values of the rendered variables,

- Conditional substitution (selection) based on variable value,

- Powerful pluralization with built-in rules for every locale.


## Library features

- **Built on top** of [@moebius/fluent][moebius-fluent] library,
  that on itself simplifies Fluent integration,

- **Adds helper functions** to grammY bots context to
  simplify message translation,

- Automatically uses translation locale based on the language
  selected by the user in their Telegram settings,

- Gives you **full access to `Fluent` instance**, so you can
  [configure it][moebius-fluent] yourself as you see fit,

- Uses **peer dependencies** so that you can use a wide
  combination of library versions in your project,

- **All LTS Node.js versions are supported**
  (starting from Node 12),

- **Written completely in TypeScript** from scratch in
  a very strict manner with 100% type coverage
  (and no *any*'s), ensuring that the library code is
  correct (type safe) by itself and also **provides high
  quality typing declarations** to make sure that your
  code is also correct and type safe,

- **Enables amazing type completion** for your IDE
  (even if you are not using TypeScript) thanks to the
  provided typing declarations,

- **Minimal possible dependencies**
  (all are high quality ones) updated to the latest versions,

- **Source maps** for the library is generated and provided
  to you for easier debugging.


## Install

Install the libraries:

```shell
npm install --save @moebius/grammy-fluent @moebius/fluent
```


## Prior knowledge

> It is highly advisable to read [@moebius/fluent][moebius-fluent]
> as well as [fluent.js][fluent-js] libraries documentation
> before using this library.


## Usage

```typescript
import { Bot, Context } from 'grammy';
import { Fluent } from '@moebius/fluent';
import { useFluent, FluentContextFlavor } from '@moebius/grammy-fluent';

// Extend your application context type with the provided
// flavor interface
export type MyAppContext = (
  & Context
  & FluentContextFlavor
);

// Create grammY bot as usual,
// specify the extended context
const bot = new Bot<MyAppContext>();

// Create an instance of @moebius/fluent and configure it
const fluent = new Fluent();

// Add translations that you need
await fluent.addTranslation({
  locales: 'en',
  source: `
-brand-name = Super Project

welcome =
  Welcome, {$name}, to the {-brand-name}!
  Your balance is: {
    NUMBER($value, maximumFractionDigits: 2)
  }
  You have { NUMBER($applesCount) ->
    [0] no apples
    [one] {$applesCount} apple
    *[other] {$applesCount} apples
  }
  `,

  // All the aspects of Fluent are highly configurable
  bundleOptions: {
    // Use this option to avoid invisible characters
    // around placeables
    useIsolating: false,
  },
});

// You can also load translations from files
await fluent.addTranslation({
  locales: 'ru',
  filePath: [
    `${__dirname}/feature-1/translation.ru.ftl`,
    `${__dirname}/feature-2/translation.ru.ftl`
  ],
});

// Add fluent middleware to the bot
bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,
}));

bot.command('i18n_test', async context => {

  // Call the "translate" or "t" helper to render the
  // message by specifying it's ID and
  // additional parameters:
  await context.reply(context.t('welcome', {
    name: context.from.first_name,
    value: 123.456,
    applesCount: 1,
  }));

  // The locale to use will be detected automatically

});
```


## API

### useFluent

```typescript
function useFluent(options: GrammyFluentOptions): Middleware;
```

Call this function to add Fluent middleware to your bot, e.g:

```typescript
bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,
}));
```

The following options are supported:

| Name             | Type             | Description                                                  |
|------------------| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fluent *         | Fluent           | A pre-configured instance of [Fluent][moebius-fluent] to use. |
| defaultLocale    | LocaleId         | A locale ID to use by default. This is used when locale negotiator returns an empty result. The default value is: "*en*". |
| localeNegotiator | LocaleNegotiator | An optional function that determines a locale to use. Check the [locale negotiation](#locale-negotiation) section below for more details. |

> Please, see [@moebius/fluent documentation][moebius-fluent]
  for all the Fluent configuration instructions.

### Context helpers

The following helpers are added to the bots' context by the
middleware:

| Name           | Type                                                         | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fluent         | Fluent                                                       | An instance of [Fluent][moebius-fluent].                           |
| translator     | Translator                                                   | An instance of [Translator][moebius-fluent].                                       |
| translate \| t | (**messageId**: string, **context**: TranslationContext) => string | Translation function bound to the automatically detected user locale. Shorthand alias "t" is also available. |

Make sure to use `FluentContextFlavor` to extend your
application context in order for typings to work correctly:

```typescript
import { Context } from 'grammy';
import { FluentContextFlavor } from '@moebius/fluent';

export type MyAppContext = (
  & Context
  & FluentContextFlavor
);

const bot = new Bot<MyAppContext>();
```

### Locale negotiation

You can use a `localeNegotiator` property to define a
custom locale negotiation function that will be called for
each Telegram update and must return a locale ID to use for
message translation.

The default negotiator will detect locale based on users
Telegram language setting.

#### API

```typescript
type LocaleNegotiator<ContextType> = (
  (context: ContextType) => (LocaleId | PromiseLike<LocaleId>)
);
```

#### Example

The example below will try to use locale ID stored
in users session:

```typescript
async function myLocaleNegotiator(context: Context) {
  return (
    (await context.session).languageId ||
    context.from.language_code ||
    'en'
  );
}

bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,

  // Telling middleware to use our custom negotiator
  localeNegotiator: myLocaleNegotiator,

  defaultLocale: 'en', // this is the default
}));
```


## Cookbook

### i18n plugin replacement

If you were using the [official i18n plugin][i18n-plugin]
with session storage, you can easily replace it using
the following code:

```typescript
bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,
  localeNegotiator: async context => (
    (await context.session).__language_code
  ),
}));
```

It will use the locale that is already stored in the user
session by the i18n plugin.
