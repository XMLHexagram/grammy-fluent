[Fluent][fluent-website] localization system integration
for [grammY]([grammy-website]) Telegram bot framework.


## Why Fluent?

I've studied several i18n standards and message formats and
have found that Fluent has all the required features and
at the same time provides a very user-friendly message format,
which is very important for non-dev people (i.e. translators).

It is also supported by Mozilla Foundation a well-respected
leader in world of OpenSource and the Web standards.

### Message format example

Consider the following message format example and see for yourself:

```fluent
-brand-name = Super Project

welcome =
  Welcome, {$name}, to the {-brand-name}!
  Your balance is: {
    NUMBER($value, maximumFractionDigits: 2)
  }
  You have { NUMBER($applesCount) ->
    [0] no apples
    [one] {$applesCount} apple
    *[other] {$applesCount} apples
  }
```

### Fluent features

- Variable substitution (aka placeables),

- Built-in and custom formatters that could be applied
  to the values of the rendered variables,

- Conditional substitution (selection) based on variable value,

- Powerful pluralization with built-in rules for every locale.


## Library features

- **Built on top** of [@moebius/fluent][moebius-fluent] library,
  that on itself simplifies Fluent integration,

- **Adds helper functions** to grammY bot's context to
  simplify message translation,

- Automatically uses translation locale based on the language
  selected by the user in their Telegram settings,

- Gives you **full access to `Fluent` instance**, so you can
  [configure it][moebius-fluent] yourself as you see fit,

- Uses **peer dependencies** so that you can use a wide
  combination of library versions in your project,

- **All LTS Node.js versions are supported**
  (starting from Node 12),

- **Written completely in TypeScript** from scratch in
  a very strict manner with 100% type coverage
  (and no *any*'s), ensuring that the library code is
  correct (type safe) by itself and also **provides high
  quality typing declarations** to make sure that your
  code is also correct and type safe,

- **Enables amazing type completion** for your IDE

  (even if you are not using TypeScript) thanks to the
  provided typing declarations,

- **Minimal possible dependencies**
  (all are high quality ones) updated to the latest versions,

- **Source maps** for the library is generated and provided
  to you for easier debugging.


## Install

Install the libraries:

```shell
npm install --save @moebius/grammy-fluent @moebius/fluent
```


## Usage

```typescript
import { Fluent } from '@moebius/fluent';

// Create an instance of @moebius/fluent and configure it
const fluent = new Fluent();

// Add trsnslations that you need
await fluent.addTranslation({
  locales: 'en',
  source: `
-brand-name = Super Project

welcome =
  Welcome, {$name}, to the {-brand-name}!
  Your balance is: {
    NUMBER($value, maximumFractionDigits: 2)
  }
  You have { NUMBER($applesCount) ->
    [0] no apples
    [one] {$applesCount} apple
    *[other] {$applesCount} apples
  }
  `,

  // All the aspects of Fluent are highly configurable
  bundleOptions: {
    // Use this option to avoid invisible characters
    // around placeables
    useIsolating: false,
  },
});

// Add fluent middleware to the bot
bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,
}));

bot.command('i18n_test', async context => {

  // Call the "translate" or "t" helper to render the
  // message by specifying it's ID and
  // additional parameters:
  await context.reply(context.t('welcome', {
    name: context.from.first_name,
    value: 123.456,
    applesCount: 1,
  }));

  // The locale to use will be detected automatically

});
```


## API

### useFluent

```typescript
function useFluent(options: GrammyFluentOptions): Middleware;
```

Call this function to add Fluent middleware to your bot, e.g:

```typescript
bot.use(useFluent({
  fluent,
}));
```

The following options are supported:

| Name   | Type   | Description                                   |
| ------ | ------ |-----------------------------------------------|
| fluent | Fluent | A pre-configured instance of [Fluent][moebius-fluent] to use. |

> Please, see [@moebius/fluent documentation]([moebius-fluent])
  for all the Fluent configuration instructions.

### Context helpers

The following helpers are added to the bot's context by the
middleware:

| Name           | Type                                                         | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fluent         | Fluent                                                       | An instance of [Fluent][moebius-fluent].                           |
| translator     | Translator                                                   | An instance of [Translator][moebius-fluent].                                       |
